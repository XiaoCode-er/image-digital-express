# image-digital-express

1.The file (image_calculation.py) is a class of image numeric claculation 
  This class includes the calculation of iamge mean ,variance and information entropy.
  
2.The file (cluster_mean_variance.py) which use the image means and variance as the feature vector calculates cluster centers and     radius of the iamge dataset.

3.The file "cluster_pic.py" plots the scatter of image means and variance.
  Classify the image dataset after explioting the file (cluster_mean_variance.py) produce the cluster center and radius.Then using   the resultings of classification import the cluster_pic file to complete plotting.

  There is not provided the classfication file.
